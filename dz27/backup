WARNING: IMPORTANT: this backup is classified as WAITING_FOR_WALS, meaning that Barman has not received yet all the required WAL files for the backup consistency.
This is a common behaviour in concurrent backup scenarios, and Barman automatically set the backup as DONE once all the required WAL files have been archived.
Hint: execute the backup command with '--wait'
